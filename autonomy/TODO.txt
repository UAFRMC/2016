TODO items (plausible goals):
- Make mine mode drive while mining
- Review and add or change states 
- Test distance recorded by encoders
- Fine tune pid control (Maybe add some i and d)
- Add SW limits to roll and unroll


Maybe Unrealistic:
- New blinky based autonomy 
- Integrate encoders and blinky
- Figure out new autonomous startup sequence

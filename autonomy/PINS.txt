On each side:
	- Bin sensor
	- Drive motor encoder
	- Mine motor encoder
	- Mine head encoder
	- Side up/down tilt resistor (variable resistance)

Optical input CAT5:

LED supply bus, ideally fixed at 1.3VDC,
probably just limited to 100mA with a 50ohm to 5VDC.
	Power (50ohm to 5VDC) on orange, ground on Worange

brown: Analog 5V soft reference, for low-current sources

pulled-down resistance measuring lines x5:
	Wgreen	A0	A6	Rwheel - DN 108
	blue	A1	A7	Bucket rheostat - 
		DN 949 fully up
		DN 330 mining head will drag on bar
		DN 260 mining starts on level ground
		DN 240 conservative mining depth
		DN 180 fully down
	Wblue	A2	A8	-spare-
	green	A3	A9	Mine - DN 912
	Wbrown	A4	A10	Lwheel - DN 91

Each of these has a 100 ohm input filter, and 2K ohm pull-down (2.5mA draw at 5V).
They're designed to take optical diode input, or a potentiometer in the Kohm range.

Power input:

Common gnd with battery
Battery in feeds 7805 (style) 3-pin regulator.
Idle draw of mega is about 110mA from battery.  Adding one LED bumps this to 175mA.
The regulator does get hot in operation.

Analog A12 is fed with battery voltage through a 1:11 voltage divider (20Kohm and 2Kohm resistances, idle current 1mA at 22VDC).  
	unsigned int mV=(analogRead(A12)*long(11)*5000)/1024;
On USB power: 12.09V -> DN 235
On USB power: 24.18V -> DN 474
23.25V -> DN 458
